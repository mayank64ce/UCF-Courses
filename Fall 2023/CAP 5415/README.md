Course Website: [CAP 5415](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/courses/cap5415-fall-2023/)

**Course Contents**

This introductory course will focus on traditional methods as well as modern deep learning approaches for computer vision. We will cover the fundamentals of imaging geometry, camera modeling and calibration, and image filtering. Following this, we will focus on feature detection, edge detection, image classification, scene understanding, object detection, and optical flow, where we will cover both classical as well as deep learning approaches. At the end of this course, the student will have an in-depth understanding of how computer vision works, design and implement computer vision algorithms, and pursue advanced topics in computer vision research. A tentative list of topics to be covered in this course,

- Mathematical Preliminaries
- Imaging Geometry, Camera models, Coordinate Transforms
- Image Filtering, Edge Detection, Feature Extraction
- Basics of Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition
